Because Of You
ne-yo

Want to but I can't help it
I love the way you feel
just kinda stuck between
my fantasy and what is real
I needed when I want it
I want it when I don't
tell myself I stop every day
knowing that I won't
I got a problem and I
don't know what to do about it
even If I did I don't know
If I would quit but I doubt it I’m
taking by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
baby you
have become my addiction
I’m so strung out on you
I can barely move
but I like it
and it's all because of you

and it's all because of you
and it's all because of you
so and it's all because
never get enough
she’s the sweetest drugs

think of it every second
I can get nothing done
only concern is the next time
I’m gon get me some
know I should stay away from
cause its no good for me
I try and try but my
obsession won’t let me leave
I got a problem and I
don't know what to do about it
even If I did I don't know If
I would quit but I doubt it I’m
taking by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
baby you
have become my addiction
I am so strung out on you
I can barely move
but I like it
so and it's all because of you
so and it's all because of you
and it's all because of you
so and it's all because of
never get enough
she is so sweet as drugs

And I know this much is true
I’m so strung out on you
have become my addiction
I’m so strung out on you
of you of you

and it's all because of you
so and it's all because of you
never get enough
she’s the sweetest drugs
she’s the sweetest drugs
